# unity-finite-state-machine

A finite state machine using push and pop with a stack.

## Demo Scene
Contains a game object with a state machine controlled by your keyboard.

## Keys
A: Enter jumping state;
S: Enter idle state.

## Dependencies
The project needs TextMesh Pro.

## Next steps
- Remove duplicated timer code used to pop up the current state tick;
- Remove all code for the state name pop up and add a better solution.

## Peek() every frame
For demonstration purposes only. This is not the best approach check and run the current state's Tick method.
